# Arthur Rochesso

Mathematics and technology have always been my passion. I always enjoyed exploring different linux distributions, building my own pc, creating excel spreadsheets using vba and solving maths problems.

I have completed my degree in Mathematics in 2018, worked as a maths teacher and it was amazing, but it was in 2020 after moving to England that someone introduced me to the web development world, and I found it fascinating how it's possible to create basically anything coding.

Since then, learning about web development has become my hobby, and when I am coding, time just flies. Instead of watching a TV show or playing a game, coding is my new way to have fun, and why not work with something you love to do? That's how I decided to become a full stack web developer.

As a self-taught full stack web developer, I possess exceptional problem-solving, analytical thinking, and strategic planning skills. I am highly adaptable to change and possess an eagerness to learn and expand my capabilities.

I have completed numerous online courses and personal projects that have allowed me to develop a deep understanding of the development and deployment process for many web-based technologies. These projects are available to review here on my GitHub profile.

As a highly motivated individual, I am committed to launching a successful career building web applications and services. I am confident in my ability to apply my technical skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions that meet the needs of users.

I am eager to bring my skills and expertise to a new team.
